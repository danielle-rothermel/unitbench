## Environment

- node v22.23.0 · pnpm 9.15.2 · Playwright 1.61 (chromium installed)
- DATABASE_URL reachable: y (Neon, `published_predictions` 74,032 rows on 2026-07-04)
- Library repos present: dr-code, dr-providers, dr-graph, dr-serialize, dr-platform, whetstone-ai (all read-only except new `serve` branches)
- Verification gates: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build`, e2e via `pnpm test:e2e` (Playwright, dev server on port 3211)

### 2026-07-04 — iteration 1: bootstrap + stage 0.1 (diagnostics integrity, P0)

- Landed: `workbench` branch; `typecheck` + `test:e2e` scripts; Playwright
  harness (`playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/home.spec.ts` smoke test asserting
  home renders with zero console errors); vitest now excludes `e2e/**`.
- Stage 0.1 fix in `src/lib/prediction-diagnostics.ts`:
  - `buildScoringStage`: `scoring_status === 'scored'` now maps to new
    neutral `completed` status with statusLabel `scored` (blue pill) —
    stage completion no longer reads "Passed" on failed predictions.
  - `buildEvaluationStage` + `derivePrimaryFailureReason`: when
    `failures > total`, render explicit marker
    "N failures reported for M evaluation cases — inconsistent data"
    (new `inconsistent` status, yellow pill) instead of "N/M failed";
    no silent normalization. Exported `formatInconsistentEvaluation`.
  - `PipelineStageInfo` gained optional `statusLabel` display override;
    `PredictionDiagnosticsPanel` renders it and maps the two new statuses
    (completed → blue tokens, inconsistent → yellow tokens).
- Tests: 2 new unit tests (scoring neutral on failed prediction;
  failures>total flags inconsistent across stage/testSummary/primary
  reason) + fixture-driven component test file
  `PredictionDiagnosticsPanel.test.tsx` (marker always present when
  failures>total, "N/M failed" never rendered; scoring pill reads
  "scored" not "passed").
- Verified: `pnpm typecheck` ✓, `pnpm lint` ✓, `pnpm test` ✓ (20 files,
  132 tests), `pnpm build` ✓, `pnpm test:e2e` ✓ (1 test), detector `[]`
  on changed tsx.
- Choices recorded: `completed` uses `--blue` tokens (neutral, distinct
  from green pass); `inconsistent` uses `--yellow` tokens with explicit
  "inconsistent data" status word (distinct from pending by wording);
  inconsistency check requires both counts present — a null total stays
  `unknown`, an explicit total smaller than failures flags.
- Noted for later stage-0 work: AppShell brand + page title are both
  `<h1>` (two h1s per page) — fold into typography/consistency pass.

### Next iteration

Stage 0.2: heatmap rebuild in place (`ScoreHeatmap.tsx`) — role="grid"
semantics, axis headers, accessible cell names, contrast-computed cell
text, client-only DndContext mount gate; e2e proving zero console
errors + grid semantics + ≥4.5:1 computed contrast.
